##
Hyperparameters govern the training process for the deep learning model. kerasTuner is an easy, scalable hyperparameter optimization framework to find the best hyperparameter combination in search space using different search strategies such as RandomSerach, Hyberband, and BayesianOptimization as determined by the objective function
